# React Redux writing...


## Requirements
* node `^5.0.0`
* yarn `^0.23.0` or npm `^3.0.0`



```bash
$ yarn  # Install project dependencies (or `npm install`)
```

## Running the Project

After completing the [installation](#installation) step, you're ready to start the project!

```bash
$ yarn start  # Start the development server (or `npm start`)
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:3000`|
|`build`            |Builds the application to ./dist|
|`test`             |Runs unit tests with Karma. See [testing](#testing)|
|`test:watch`       |Runs `test` in watch mode to re-run tests when changed|
|`lint`             |[Lints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) the project for potential errors|
|`lint:fix`         |Lints the project and [fixes all correctable errors](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix)|
